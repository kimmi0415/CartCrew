CartCrew is an Android app that streamlines household supplies management. It enables multiple users to collaboratively build a shopping list, individually purchase items, and settle the differences so that the costs are split evenly across all roommates. The app was made in Android Studio using Java and uses the Firebase Realtime Database for real-time updating and Firebase Authentication for user account management.
